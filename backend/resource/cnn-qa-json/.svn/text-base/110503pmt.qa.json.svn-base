[{"question":"Anything yet?","answer":"We don\u0027t know what\u0027s there.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":45,"aSentId":46},{"question":"And Nic, given all what you\u0027ve found out there, I mean is it -- is it credible that no one at any high government level or military level in Pakistan had a clue that bin Laden was in this compound?","answer":"You know I think the best clues that we have come from the neighbors.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":57,"aSentId":58},{"question":"When you saw the detail of this operation, what were your thoughts?","answer":"Well, you know, obviously, I was elated the SEALs, you know, were involved, and at the pointy edge, but also, you know, I look at it and I understand it\u0027s a team effort.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":77,"aSentId":78},{"question":"I mean do you care either way?","answer":"Well, these guys are pros.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":86,"aSentId":87},{"question":"But from your point of view, is this the stuff that you train for?","answer":"Absolutely.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":98,"aSentId":99},{"question":"Would it have bothered you in that situation whether he was armed or not?","answer":"It wouldn\u0027t have bothered me a bit, Piers.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":113,"aSentId":114},{"question":"Why are they special?","answer":"Well, just look at the basic training.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":122,"aSentId":123},{"question":"What goes through your mind?","answer":"Well, you know, as Ryan had mentioned, one of the most important things, is that these guys had been trained time and time again, and so they have built up a level of inoculation to stress, so that they\u0027re able to rely on their training in those moments.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":142,"aSentId":143},{"question":"Are we ever going to know who they are?","answer":"Well, I hope not.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":149,"aSentId":150},{"question":"Is that what you would hope would happen?","answer":"Well, you know, it\u0027s surprising that the numbers have remained relatively stable.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":175,"aSentId":176},{"question":"I mean to take out bin Laden and the fact that it was a SEAL team that did this, pretty special day?","answer":"It\u0027s a very special day.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":191,"aSentId":192},{"question":"What is the current situation with regard to those?","answer":"Why, I think as we\u0027ve indicated during the course of the last several days, we\u0027re making some consideration of the potential ramifications of the release of any such photos.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":210,"aSentId":211},{"question":"I mean one final question with regard to the pictures, have you actually seen them yourself?","answer":"I\u0027ve seen some pictures, yes.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":222,"aSentId":223},{"question":"ORGAN: And what do they depict?","answer":"I\u0027m not going to get into trying to describe them.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":224,"aSentId":225},{"question":"Were you able to actually see any video footage from the scene as it happened?","answer":"No, we weren\u0027t able to see video footage from the scene.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":229,"aSentId":230},{"question":"Do you know if the president had spoken directly to the Navy SEALs involved in this mission yet?","answer":"He has not yet, no.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":244,"aSentId":245},{"question":"Does he plan to?","answer":"I anticipate he will.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":246,"aSentId":247},{"question":"What kind of thing would you imagine he\u0027d say?","answer":"I think they\u0027ll have an opportunity to talk directly to them.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":248,"aSentId":249},{"question":"I mean, how can you trust them after this?","answer":"Well, it\u0027s not a matter of trust, it\u0027s a matter of finding common interests and working together with them.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":252,"aSentId":253},{"question":"If Pakistan was hunting a terrorist who had killed over 3,000 of their people and they discovered after 10 years that he was residing in a compound right next to an American military base where your senior intelligence people were also working, they\u0027d be entitled to be pretty cheesed off, wouldn\u0027t they?","answer":"Well, it\u0027s kind of a perfect hypothetical, Piers, that I\u0027m going to not -- I\u0027m going to choose to not answer.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":265,"aSentId":266},{"question":"And finally, what was your personal reaction the moment you heard that the mission was successful and bin Laden was dead?","answer":"My personal reaction was threefold.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":268,"aSentId":269},{"question":"I mean I don\u0027t doubt for a moment that all those thoughts were in your mind, but I kind of hoped for a slightly more spontaneous one-liner when you heard that he was dead, something along the lines of \"got him\" or something?","answer":"Well, that\u0027s exactly what the president said, but that spontaneity is not my strong suit, and spontaneity is not a big characteristic in the situation room.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":277,"aSentId":278},{"question":"Would you release them?","answer":"This is not a major with me, but I have spoken to people who have seen the pictures.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":292,"aSentId":293},{"question":"I mean, it\u0027s the same thing, isn\u0027t it?","answer":"I agree.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":304,"aSentId":305},{"question":"And do you believe, if that\u0027s the case, that vindicate the case for interrogation methods like waterboarding?","answer":"Let me say, first of all, I don\u0027t consider it torture.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":320,"aSentId":321},{"question":"Would you have been perfectly happy for them to be waterboarded and put through all the other things that you think are perfectly acceptable for the people at, say, Guantanamo Bay?","answer":"Two things, one, Navy SEALS are waterboarded as part of their training.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":348,"aSentId":349},{"question":"So how effective is it?","answer":"ING: No, I\u0027ve spoken to people on the ground, people who were involved in that.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":358,"aSentId":359},{"question":"Why?","answer":"We\u0027ve always considered it torture.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":374,"aSentId":375},{"question":"I mean, President Bush insisted that he did it within the law, and that if it hadn\u0027t been deemed lawful, he wouldn\u0027t have authorized it?","answer":"I think it\u0027s called plausible deniability, where John Yoo, who wrote the memo, said, look, I\u0027m just a lawyer; I didn\u0027t make the decision.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":380,"aSentId":381},{"question":"Where is the line drawn as far as you\u0027re concerned?","answer":"First of all, I think waterboarding is torture.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":395,"aSentId":396},{"question":"If it works, should you use it?","answer":"I don\u0027t think it should be used, but I think we ought to know that we are sacrificing a great deal.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":400,"aSentId":401},{"question":"Are you in favor of it, then, or not?","answer":"I am not in favor of it, but I understand why many Americans would favor it.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":415,"aSentId":416},{"question":"How do you get this kind of information out of implacable enemies who are prepared to dies for their cause, if you\u0027re not going to use some form of aggressive interrogation?","answer":"If you bought into the last administration\u0027s argument that everyone at Guantanamo was the worst of the worst, the kind of people that would chew through the hydraulic lines of the airplane to kill Americans, then maybe waterboarding perhaps would not be considered unacceptable.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":424,"aSentId":425},{"question":"What do you do to get that information out of them?","answer":"Well, Piers, I agree.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":430,"aSentId":431},{"question":"What I want to ask you both very quickly -- let me start with you, colonel, should we publish the picture of a dead Osama bin Laden?","answer":"I don\u0027t -- as someone mentioned earlier, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any debate about the fact that he\u0027s dead.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":471,"aSentId":472},{"question":"Why?","answer":"Well, he\u0027s gotten a measure of credit, which he deserves.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":486,"aSentId":487},{"question":"What\u0027s your gut feeling request?","answer":"The flip side of the commander in chief making the decision that he did, and being rightly credited for it, is that that decision was predicated on policies that he reviled.","docId":"110503pmt","qSentId":515,"aSentId":516}]
