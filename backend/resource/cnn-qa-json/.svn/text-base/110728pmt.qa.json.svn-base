short-term bill that has us going back at these three months from now when you\u0027ve seen how much trouble it\u0027s causing now will just roil the credit markets, risk our credit agency, and tie up the Congress from doing other things like focusing on jobs and the economy.","docId":"110728pmt","qSentId":256,"aSentId":257},{"question":"I mean the reality is that you guys have continued to preside

reformation?","answer":"First of all, the way we need to approach tax reform, which I think most of the experts acknowledge, is to reduce rates and reduce the tax expenditures accordingly, and then
