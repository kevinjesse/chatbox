sons were ever in proper custody or were we just spun a yarn here?","answer":"Yes, it\u0027s difficult to say in this place, isn\u0027t it, because one correspondent who\u0027s been here much longer

bringing him back to justice, which would you prefer?","answer":"Moammar Gadhafi should be brought to justice and I think that it\u0027s important that the U.S. government does not try to broker a deal to find him asylum or grant him immunity, but he should be adjudicated either in the Libyan -- in the Libyan judicial system that needs to be revamped or with the international criminal court.","docId":"110822pmt","qSentId":184,"aSentId":185},{"question":"Are you questioning by judgment or what?","answer":"I\u0027m already questioning your

do.","docId":"110822pmt","qSentId":236,"aSentId":237},{"question":"But does America have a fundamental problem businesswise with the sheer volume of paperwork, red tape, legalese, stuff that I believe
