view?","answer":"Well, as a partner with New York City, Office of Emergency Management, of course, in the state of New York, the FEMA

feeling it won\u0027t be as bad because I think the storm will start as it starts to shear as it moves over the colder water, because it\u0027s not moving fast enough.","docId":"110826pmt","qSentId":338,"aSentId":339},{"question":"Finally, if you would give me a one word answer -- if you\u0027re in New York now, should you leave?","answer":"If you\u0027re

tell me what\u0027s is going on right now in your state?","answer":"Right now, Piers, what\u0027s happening is that the window for preparation time is really coming to a close, as we anticipate the

redundancy.","docId":"110826pmt","qSentId":579,"aSentId":580},{"question":"Piers?","answer":"Well, it\u0027s a very worrying situation, Chad.","docId":"110826pmt","qSentId":609,"aSentId":610}]
