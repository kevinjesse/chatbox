you think?","answer":"Well, I think it\u0027s quite likely.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":97,"aSentId":98},{"question":"What do you make of that?","answer":"Well, I would say more specifically that the GOP voters are not put off by these allegations because they went through the sexual harassment whiplash of the \u002790s, of the Anita Hill accusations against Clarence Thomas, then the Paula Jones accusations against President Clinton, where we saw a lot of feminists, you know, frankly, changing their tune when it came with sexual harassment.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":110,"aSentId":111},{"question":"What does that tell you about the nature of these allegations?","answer":"Well, it tells me two

would that make any difference in terms of the veracity of the allegations?","answer":"Well, in the case involving Thomas -- not in terms of veracity, but in terms of whether there\u0027s any racism involved.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":143,"aSentId":144},{"question":"Alan?","answer":"I think he does if it\u0027s not quid pro quo sexual harassment.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":158,"aSentId":159},{"question":"OK, Amy?","answer":"I think it\u0027s far too early to tell, but I would say that Herman Cain should have given Mike Murphy a call, and he was the GOP strategist who had Arnold Schwarzenegger say, where there\u0027s smoke, there\u0027s fire.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":162,"aSentId":163},{"question":"But what do you think

about throwing my own hat in the ring.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":237,"aSentId":238},{"question":"What did you conclude about that period in your life?","answer":"Well, first of all, there was the relief that I finally finished the writing, which, as you know, can be quite trying.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":253,"aSentId":254},{"question":"How have I done there?","answer":"Let\u0027s start

think?","answer":"Well, revolutions are not pretty, and there are any number of circumstances in which the tyrant who stays too long and refuses to leave and when fear breaks down, and on behalf of his people, and the tables are turned, those ends are often very violent.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":322,"aSentId":323},{"question":"Do you look at what\u0027s happened to Barack and Gadhafi, and

me.","docId":"111102pmt","qSentId":389,"aSentId":390},{"question":"So I guess mixed feelings?","answer":"Well, of course, it was a wonderful experience, and it was a very high honor, as I

say?","answer":"Well, clearly, associating the United States of America firmly with the freedom agenda in the Middle East after 60 years of trying to trade democracy for stability and getting neither,
