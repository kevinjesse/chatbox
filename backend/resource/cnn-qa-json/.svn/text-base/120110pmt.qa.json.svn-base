of your opponents now has the kind of financial muscle to play dirty in the way that you have?","answer":"Well, I don\u0027t think we say -- you\u0027re saying we had

crowded field like that and from his perspective, the two candidates he probably feared the most, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, they did not do well coming in fourth and

want to find yourself, isn\u0027t it?","answer":"Well, we didn\u0027t compete in New Hampshire so it doesn\u0027t surprise us that our score there was a bit on the low side.","docId":"120110pmt","qSentId":267,"aSentId":268},{"question":"What are you going to do to turn around your fortunes given the fairly (INAUDIBLE) state you\u0027re in at the

debates such a struggle?","answer":"Well, actually, the last three or four debates I think we performed at a rather high level.","docId":"120110pmt","qSentId":298,"aSentId":299},{"question":"Because

that I got behind John McCain?","answer":"OK.","docId":"120110pmt","qSentId":422,"aSentId":423},{"question":"I mean he\u0027s not doing badly for somebody that everyone else says they\u0027re not very enthusiastic about?","answer":"Well, he is winning.","docId":"120110pmt","qSentId":428,"aSentId":429},{"question":"But who do you think he would have been steering to?","answer":"Oh, my father never

it all to do, hasn\u0027t he?","answer":"Well, what\u0027s happened over the last few months is -- we\u0027ve had a focus on the Republican Party and the Republican candidates with the media focusing on the Republican Party and what does it stand for and it\u0027s been a diversion from what does Barack Obama stand for and what has he been able to

he?","answer":"Yes.","docId":"120110pmt","qSentId":511,"aSentId":512},{"question":"The fact that he\u0027s now turning mean, I guess, is the story because he tried to present himself as the new Newt, the nice Newt, the saintly Newt and it didn\u0027t work and now he\u0027s going to go back to the way perhaps a more traditional Newt would have behaved which is when an opponent whacks him he\u0027s
