been going on this week in court?","answer":"Well, you know, I\u0027m so thankful that these survivors came forward because maybe we can put an end to the notion that, A, boys don\u0027t get sexually abused, or the fact that we can\u0027t get enough evidence to get what I think is frankly a monster who has groomed, who used his power of authority to take advantage of these victims -- survivors and survivors and their families.","docId":"120614pmt","qSentId":97,"aSentId":98},{"question":"And what difference does that make to a jury\u0027s ability to comprehend perhaps some of what is going on

and friends?","answer":"Well, unfortunately, when you have been abused the way they were abused, not just abused physically but also emotionally, and abuse of trust, every trauma can be a layer.","docId":"120614pmt","qSentId":135,"aSentId":136},{"question":"What do you think these boys who are now men have been going through to have to relive in public what they went

testifying, too, and how they\u0027re having to relive it as I talk to you tonight.","docId":"120614pmt","qSentId":200,"aSentId":201},{"question":"Do you think it\u0027s conceivable that Dottie

sensitive to that, that charge that actually the drive to push out Barack Obama from the Republican side and Governor Romney\u0027s side, that actually the national interest can get damaged here, and that there is a need up to the election for the business of running America to be allowed to continue?","answer":"Well, Piers, one of the unfulfilled promises of the Obama presidency is his explicit pledge to change Washington and to reduce the partisanship there.","docId":"120614pmt","qSentId":425,"aSentId":426},{"question":"Are you feeling increasingly confident in the Romney camp?","answer":"Well, I think what I would say is we\u0027re cognizant of the fact -- well, I don\u0027t know if I can say it in one word.","docId":"120614pmt","qSentId":434,"aSentId":435},{"question":"So you\u0027ve definitely hit a bit of a wall at a very difficult time for you with the campaign, haven\u0027t you?","answer":"Well, Piers, what I was going to say, if I were able to finish what I was about to say, was that the president has continuously said, well, we\u0027ve made progress.","docId":"120614pmt","qSentId":480,"aSentId":481},{"question":"What are the admissions that you\u0027re prepared to make to the American public as we head towards the
