discovered from 350 separate interviews with people who knew him very well?","answer":"He\u0027s introspective, he\u0027s cautious, he\u0027s what I call a partisan observer in his own

venal.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":159,"aSentId":160},{"question":"A timidity?","answer":"Well, and a little bit -- you know, it\u0027s interesting because he always dismissed his mother as being naive but he came into the presidency with a little bit of naivete in terms of thinking that that grand speech he gave in 2004 bringing the whole country together, which in my book, in my interview, he said that he couldn\u0027t find a reason to exist if not for that universality.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":163,"aSentId":164},{"question":"-- did you see that now in the

did.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":246,"aSentId":247},{"question":"OK, so total everything, how much are we looking at?","answer":"Like $155.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":256,"aSentId":257},{"question":"I mean is it -- is the reality that they do have hundreds of thousands of dollars?","answer":"There\u0027s no question that they were talking in this sort of simplistic kind of code where they were talking about $155 when, without question, they were talking about $155,000.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":262,"aSentId":263},{"question":"So I mean if you were putting a prosecutorial hat on, rather your current defense hat, you can see why the prosecution would be pretty agitated, can you?","answer":"No question, they did not tell a complete truth to the judge.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":282,"aSentId":283},{"question":"I mean it doesn\u0027t help you, to be brutally frank, does it not, that they appear to have lied in this, because when it comes to George Zimmerman defending himself and saying X, Y, Z, about what happened with Trayvon Martin, there will be critics now, understandably, saying, why should we believe you?","answer":"Absolutely true.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":289,"aSentId":290},{"question":"-- that you can believe now what George

it.","docId":"120618pmt","qSentId":303,"aSentId":304},{"question":"That he could just be now in jail for possibly up to two years before this come to trial?","answer":"Judge Lester put his neck out
