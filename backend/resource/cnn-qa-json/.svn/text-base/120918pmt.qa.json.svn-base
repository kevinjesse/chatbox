fire.","docId":"120918pmt","qSentId":114,"aSentId":115},{"question":"How can he work on that?","answer":"Well --","docId":"120918pmt","qSentId":129,"aSentId":130},{"question":"How can he improve the

that you do have to say go closer to an apology if not -- if not outright apologize.","docId":"120918pmt","qSentId":246,"aSentId":247},{"question":"Isn\u0027t it a problem -- Michael Gerson, isn\u0027t the real problem for Mitt Romney is that this lends succor now to the argument that he basically is pretty two-faced when it comes to principles and his political views?","answer":"Well, I think that the worst kind of gaffes are the ones that confirm a stereotype.","docId":"120918pmt","qSentId":251,"aSentId":252},{"question":"Do you think as things stand, that Mitt Romney can still win

probably not quite as much as you have, Joel, but he\u0027s done OK for himself, that he gets lambasted for his success, lambasted for making that money, that somehow it\u0027s become a bad thing to be rich and successful in America?","answer":"I do.","docId":"120918pmt","qSentId":386,"aSentId":387},{"question":"You must feel offended when you hear him say something like that, don\u0027t
