gaffe element and the rhetoric, and you cut to his principle point that he claims he\u0027s been making a lot on the stump which is that, you know, a lot of people in America, mainly the ones who vote for Barack Obama don\u0027t much tax, they don\u0027t pay income tax, and are basically living off government handouts?","answer":"Well, that particularly argument is not one that I would have made,
