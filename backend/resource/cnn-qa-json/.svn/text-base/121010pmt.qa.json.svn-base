Rice was simply wrong?","answer":"Well, I think as more information came out, the initial information that would -- that they had was perceived to be that the attack was the result of protests and as

complicated and detailed and rather than say absolutely nothing, rather than -- you know, than not give information to the American people, Ambassador Rice went out and talked about what they believed to be happening at the time with the information on -- from the intelligence community that she had.","docId":"121010pmt","qSentId":211,"aSentId":212},{"question":"Pretty un-American to be putting out completely false statements before you know the facts, isn\u0027t it?","answer":"Piers, it is not, it is not OK for you to be saying that the administration was putting out completely false statements.","docId":"121010pmt","qSentId":228,"aSentId":229},{"question":"What?","answer":"It doesn\u0027t mean that it wasn\u0027t

expectations, I think we\u0027re going to be talking about how good Obama was because no one -- everyone is going to be comparing it to his last debate.","docId":"121010pmt","qSentId":388,"aSentId":389},{"question":"So is this a lie?","answer":"I mean Governor Romney has made very clear that if a bill comes to his desk, that overturns \"Roe
