[{"question":"Dana, I take it they started the actual debate, the vote could be fairly soon?","answer":"Well, they have started the debate on the procedural issues, but I just actually am getting an e-mail right now saying that the final vote, it doesn\u0027t look like it will happen until much later, until some time between 11:15 and 11:45 Eastern.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":16,"aSentId":17},{"question":"If the majority is not there of the Republicans who are the majority in the House, he\u0027s not going to bring it up for a vote, or are they discarding that given this current crisis?","answer":"He\u0027s never been officially wedded to that majority of the majority idea.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":31,"aSentId":32},{"question":"So there\u0027s a possibility that he might actually go before cameras and make a statement assuming it passes the House?","answer":"They\u0027re not saying that, but he is -- he is here in the building, and this would be a victory.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":53,"aSentId":54},{"question":"I take it there\u0027s no full lid, as they say, over in the West Wing at the White House, meaning that there\u0027s still a possibility that the TV crew are still there?","answer":"They are still there.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":59,"aSentId":60},{"question":"Congresswoman, you\u0027re going to vote which way for this Senate bill?","answer":"Hi, Wolf.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":84,"aSentId":85},{"question":"Are you going to vote in favor of the Senate bill or are you going to vote against it?","answer":"I\u0027m a very reluctant yes, Wolf, because under these circumstances which exist, this last-minute situation exists because the folks just back behind me in the Senate chamber, Senator Reid, could not get the Senate to act on any of the great bills for the American people we sent before, this is the best we can do given the Senate and the White House sentiment at this point in time.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":87,"aSentId":88},{"question":"Is that a correct assumption?","answer":"I think that\u0027s probably a valid assumption, Wolf.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":92,"aSentId":93},{"question":"And so you assume like I do that it will pass the House of Representatives, a bipartisan majority, more than 217 votes and it will go to the president for his signature perhaps as early as tomorrow?","answer":"That\u0027s what I anticipate, Wolf, and I certainly will be glad to get this particular issue settled and now it\u0027s on to tackling that hideous problem that we have and we owe it to the American people to do everything we can.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":98,"aSentId":99},{"question":"LITZER: How many Democrats -- how many Democrats do you think will vote in favor of this Senate-passed version?","answer":"Well, I think it\u0027s hard to say.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":162,"aSentId":163},{"question":"Do you have any doubt that this legislation will be passed tonight?","answer":"Well, I\u0027m pretty confident that the legislation is going to pass, what I\u0027m hopeful is, really, actually anyone watching this, Wolf, should have just taken out some stock in Dramamine because the rollercoaster ride that has resulted from us getting to this process really has been unfortunate and unnecessary but we\u0027re here.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":173,"aSentId":174},{"question":"What do you say to those colleagues of yours who don\u0027t like this deal?","answer":"Well, I\u0027m a progressive.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":178,"aSentId":179},{"question":"But you agree, Grover, with Debbie Wasserman Schultz, if you were a member of the House or the Senate, you\u0027d be voting for this legislation as well?","answer":"Yes.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":200,"aSentId":201},{"question":"But -- I just want to make sure -- I just want to point out, Grover Norquist, though, having said all that and everything you said, you are giving cover to those Republicans who will vote in favor of the Senate legislation in the next hour or two?","answer":"They\u0027re not -- they\u0027re not voting for a tax increase, they\u0027re voting to save tax cuts for as many people as they can over Obama\u0027s objections.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":235,"aSentId":236},{"question":"Yes, I assume you\u0027re in favor of this Senate-passed language?","answer":"Oh, I\u0027m going to vote for it.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":252,"aSentId":253},{"question":"Is that the number you\u0027re hearing?","answer":"Well, I\u0027m interested in seeing how many votes the Republicans are going to provide.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":262,"aSentId":263},{"question":"You say children, you\u0027re talking about the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader?","answer":"I\u0027m talking about Tea Party Republicans who continue to throw temper tantrums and delay this and refuse to move forward in the spirit of compromise.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":270,"aSentId":271},{"question":"You think the Republican leadership, the speaker, the majority leader, some of the other leaders, they\u0027re all on the same page or are they fighting amongst themselves?","answer":"Oh, I think a good part of this has had nothing to do with an economic strategy.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":284,"aSentId":285},{"question":"Were you surprised the president was willing to go up to $450,000 from $250,000, which he had spoken of for months and months and months during the campaign?","answer":"Well, I wasn\u0027t completely surprised because there are a lot of Democrats particularly in the Senate, particularly representing wealthy states like New York, Chuck Schumer, for example, who always kind of wanted that threshold to go up a bit.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":312,"aSentId":313},{"question":"God deal or bad deal?","answer":"Well, I guess it depends on for who.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":333,"aSentId":334},{"question":"Who is the big political winner tonight, Ben?","answer":"I think President Obama played a much stronger hand and won with it in this sort of shoving match over -- particularly forcing Republicans to go ahead and raise taxes on the rich.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":365,"aSentId":366},{"question":"Assuming it passes, Ben Smith, what do you think the future for John Boehner, the speaker, is?","answer":"I think he was just overheard on the floor of the House calling tonight a nightmare for him.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":408,"aSentId":409},{"question":"Around 11:00, 11:15, that\u0027s when roll call will take place?","answer":"We just got a little bit of good news that it might happen in the 10:00 hour, a little bit earlier.","docId":"130101pmt","qSentId":476,"aSentId":477}]
