is?","answer":"The investigation -- well, really, I was watching your show last night, it\u0027s really from the defense side, it\u0027s damage control.","docId":"130516pmt","qSentId":216,"aSentId":217},{"question":"What would it mean legally, do you think?","answer":"Well, from a legal perspective, the problem, if I was a defense attorney --
