story.","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":149,"aSentId":150},{"question":"Donnie, how are you?","answer":"Hey, Piers.","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":167,"aSentId":168},{"question":"Where were you when you

happened.","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":235,"aSentId":236},{"question":"What do you think from all you\u0027ve gleaned about the way the money should be spent is going to be the most effective way of

Bostonian?","answer":"Well, I was born here.","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":247,"aSentId":248},{"question":"What was going on?","answer":"Well, my understanding is that Brian Panitch, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson and Michael\u0027s children, who incidentally I recommended to Katherine as the best lawyer in the country to handle this case, he\u0027s been going over e-mails with Mr. Gongaware and I\u0027m told that Mr. Gongaware is professing not to remember exactly why he did the mail or what he meant, answering very often I don\u0027t recall, I don\u0027t recall, I don\u0027t recall.","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":283,"aSentId":284},{"question":"Is it any defense to say you don\u0027t recall sending an e-mail when there\u0027s a copy of the e-mail sitting in court?","answer":"Well, it\u0027s a problem, Piers, because when a witness continues to say, says over and over, I don\u0027t recall, as apparently this witness has, then it starts to give the impression of untruthfulness to the jury and, in fact, it\u0027s reported that the jury began to laugh when this witness continued to say, I don\u0027t recall, and when the jury begins to laugh at the witness, it should be a cause for concern by the defense that perhaps the jury\u0027s thinking this witness is just not credible.","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":288,"aSentId":289},{"question":"Tom, what do you make of this case?","answer":"Well, I think it\u0027s a tragedy for this family and I think the heat is going to be so intense on the Mexican government that she\u0027ll be released at

authorities to get her out of there?","answer":"Well, I would do just exactly what was done today and CNN in fact have seen what I\u0027m going to call the smoking video.","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":303,"aSentId":304},{"question":"Did you ever think you\u0027d have to deal with three scandals like this at the same time?","answer":"I dismiss the premise, the

it surprising that you\u0027re getting some people now flipping and doing this kind of thing?","answer":"You\u0027ve always --","docId":"130530pmt","qSentId":491,"aSentId":492},{"question":"I was curious about his link -- you know, some -- not just constitutional right but a God-given right?","answer":"ILL: Well, there are a lot of people who believe that these are natural rights and these
