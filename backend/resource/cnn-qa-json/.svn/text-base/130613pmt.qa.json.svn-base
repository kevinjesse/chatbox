gone by, nearly 5,000 more Americans have been killed by guns and it seems to me, let\u0027s be brutally honest, absolutely nothing has changed and this prompts the question, if nothing changes when 20 children get murdered, when does it change?","answer":"Yes, how can you look in the eyes of the families of these murdered 6 and 7-year-olds and tell them that we can\u0027t do anything when the

we\u0027ve had it actually a number of times over the years but there\u0027s never been anything quite like this and there\u0027s never been -- you know, this is all because of what\u0027s happened

quickly?","answer":"Well, I have a great relationship with him.","docId":"130613pmt","qSentId":294,"aSentId":295},{"question":"Am I overstating things?","answer":"He\u0027s definitely a geek.","docId":"130613pmt","qSentId":318,"aSentId":319},{"question":"What is that type?","answer":"He\u0027s a little bit of a

NSA?","answer":"That\u0027s a great question.","docId":"130613pmt","qSentId":326,"aSentId":327},{"question":"The kind of picture I got from what you unearthed about him was just, you know, he\u0027s -- he\u0027s a guy with a pretty big sense of his own importance in life but that importance in life was quite important in his little world, was nowhere near important enough for him to start making decisions about national security, was it?","answer":"Well, what\u0027s important to understand is that on this forum that he was posting on, it\u0027s very for tech geeks, for IT guys, he posted nearly 800 times.","docId":"130613pmt","qSentId":342,"aSentId":343},{"question":"But am I unfair to say that?","answer":"No, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re unfair but then -- and that\u0027s one viable scenario for sure, looking at this as a psychologist, just as another person.","docId":"130613pmt","qSentId":350,"aSentId":351},{"question":"We all have our view taken from our positions but in

sad.","docId":"130613pmt","qSentId":409,"aSentId":410},{"question":"What does that tell you about America right now?","answer":"It just shows you how screwed up this country has become and how you can see someone walk into an elementary school and use that gun to kill 20 6- and 7-year-olds, to look at them and not even care when you hear them scream, and just open fire, to look at six educators who are there to teach their kids, to teach them how to write and how to do multiplication and add.","docId":"130613pmt","qSentId":417,"aSentId":418},{"question":"What do you think it\u0027s going to take
