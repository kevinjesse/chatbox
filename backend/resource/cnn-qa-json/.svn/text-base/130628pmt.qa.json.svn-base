a better day you would say for the defense?","answer":"Absolutely and ironically, Piers, the witnesses were supposed to be on the stand for the state, but it appears the testimony they gave very much benefits the defense.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":21,"aSentId":22},{"question":"In terms of describing the individuals, are you able to describe their faces or anything, or just clothing

pound?","answer":"Correct.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":34,"aSentId":35},{"question":"That it\u0027s more likely to have been the guy that\u0027s been training in that very form of martial arts?","answer":"Well, that is certainly the way the prosecution wanted to end the day and they were able to do that by talking to a physician\u0027s assistant, George Zimmerman\u0027s physician\u0027s assistant, who said on his medical records that he had listed, he had been keeping fit by doing training.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":45,"aSentId":46},{"question":"So the basic point is if everybody is contradicting each other and even themselves in various testimony that they\u0027ve given in depositions, is that enough for reasonable doubt?","answer":"Right.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":71,"aSentId":72},{"question":"Put it all together, what are you thinking?","answer":"I think he was a strong witness and a good witness for the

important.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":177,"aSentId":178},{"question":"Is there a racial element to this that you\u0027re now concerned about, in the sense that were they just not engaged with a young black girl giving evidence in the same way that they were engaged, apparently, with a eloquent, middle-class white man?","answer":"Piers, I\u0027d have to respectfully

shocked.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":228,"aSentId":229},{"question":"When she talked about, you know, creepy ass crackers and that kind of thing, did you think she was using terms that are racist or just terms that young people use these days in the era that she comes from?","answer":"Well, you know, we go to Norland that\u0027s how we talk.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":232,"aSentId":233},{"question":"Is it in terms of your experience, is it a racist term against white people?","answer":"I\u0027m not racist because I\u0027m from

sad.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":255,"aSentId":256},{"question":"Is that how you\u0027re seeing this?","answer":"Well, certainly that\u0027s going to be the bottom line in their reviewing each one on these witnesses that comes forth is that they\u0027re going to rely upon their own life experiences, and I think what was interesting about Rachel is that for many of these people, the jurors, they may have needed a cultural anthropologist to explain some of her responses but that\u0027s not going to happen.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":275,"aSentId":276},{"question":"What do you think?","answer":"I certainly agree that the defense had a great day today.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":321,"aSentId":322},{"question":"Yes, Jo-Ellan?","answer":"I have a question for the legal

Jeantel because I think that\u0027s important and a lot of that is wrapped up in a lot of the racism, classism, sexism and just a lot of the lookism that\u0027s deeply rooted in this country.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":373,"aSentId":374},{"question":"But is it impossible to eliminate race from this?","answer":"Absolutely.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":383,"aSentId":384},{"question":"When you see the reaction, putting that to one side, what kind of impact would it have on the legality of the court process itself do you think?","answer":"Well, I do think that it would have an impact on the jury, how she comes across on the witness stand, and it may be that some people who are on the jury are not understanding some of the issues of race and class that -- that have been brought up by the guests and -- but I might add that, you know, we do have this image of Oprah Winfrey who has been at some point large and African American and female and she\u0027s been one of the most loved persons in our country if not the

would be very surprised, and in constantly talking with those, it\u0027s unlikely he\u0027d take the stand.","docId":"130628pmt","qSentId":454,"aSentId":455}]
