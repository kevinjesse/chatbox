[{"question":"Did you notice anything to bring to the jury\u0027s attention today, that caused you that concern, that spidey sense that something\u0027s going wrong with what he\u0027s telling you?","answer":"Nothing I can articulate, no, sir.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":41,"aSentId":42},{"question":"Do you think given what happened today, Martin, that there\u0027s any likelihood George Zimmerman himself will give evidence now?","answer":"I would say it\u0027d be highly unlikely.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":47,"aSentId":48},{"question":"How much of that could be covered, and I stress could be, by the fact that they were criticized so widely for not taking, A, action in terms of charging Zimmerman on the night of this incident, in other words, basically, covering their own position?","answer":"Well, I mean, it\u0027s a legitimate question to ask.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":54,"aSentId":55},{"question":"Why would he feign total lack of knowledge when there\u0027s just three street names?","answer":"Well, I think that\u0027s very telling because the biggest -- the biggest I think piece of evidence against George Zimmerman is his own words to the -- to the nonemergency officer, where he said that Trayvon -- he goes oh, S, he\u0027s running, and he gets out of his car.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":104,"aSentId":105},{"question":"What did you make of it in totality?","answer":"Well, in totality, Piers, you know, I was on your show just the other day, and I was telling you how it looked

statement, what did that indicate to you?","answer":"Either he was telling the truth or he was a complete pathological liar.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":180,"aSentId":181},{"question":"You think he was telling the truth?","answer":"Yes.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":182,"aSentId":183},{"question":"In other words, this is really corroborating their own positions?","answer":"That -- obviously not the least bit naive.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":187,"aSentId":188},{"question":"Very -- yes?","answer":"There is one more thing.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":203,"aSentId":204},{"question":"Do you think that she will be called back at this stage?","answer":"Absolutely not.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":226,"aSentId":227},{"question":"Particularly the charge, I guess, that lays itself at your door that she was somehow underprepared or underrehearsed?","answer":"Well, as you know, Piers, you and I spoke, and I became Rachel\u0027s lawyer last week, and that was by request of some individuals that attend church with her, that are former law enforcement officers that believed that she was not really prepared to go to Sanford and testify in the case, that she had absolutely no clue as to what was getting ready to take place.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":230,"aSentId":231},{"question":"When you heard her say that, did you think that was a mistake, that it was obviously a

you think his testimony went down today?","answer":"Well, Chris is a straight shooter.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":327,"aSentId":328},{"question":"And because they both come out today and give extensive testimony, saying, yes, we found him very credible, and consistent and so on, that lends sucker to why they didn\u0027t do anything?","answer":"I would disagree because if you look at the situation, they\u0027re not the ones that make the charging decision.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":336,"aSentId":337},{"question":"Do you know yet what happened here to cause such a calamitous loss of life?","answer":"Well, don\u0027t really actually know.","docId":"130701pmt","qSentId":416,"aSentId":417},{"question":"In all your time as a governor, have you had to deal with anything that\u0027s
