can\u0027t say into that, correct?","answer":"That\u0027s correct, sir.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":86,"aSentId":87},{"question":"In fact, you can\u0027t testify as to who threw the first punch?","answer":"I MAIO: That\u0027s correct, sir.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":88,"aSentId":89},{"question":"In fact, you can\u0027t really testify whether there was a first punch thrown?","answer":"That\u0027s correct, sir.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":90,"aSentId":91},{"question":"What happens next procedurally in the trial?","answer":"This is the

indeed.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":114,"aSentId":115},{"question":"What is going on, do you think?","answer":"Well, this is an epic battle and at its heart, Piers, is whether or not they\u0027re going to put the dead, young man, the victim on trial here, and the defense wants to take text messages and Facebook posts that make Trayvon Martin look bad, that indicate that maybe he was talking about fighting or talking about firearms.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":118,"aSentId":119},{"question":"But how significant do you think was her testimony?","answer":"Well, she\u0027s an African-American lady who testified via Skype and I think the unspoken message from the defense was look, George Zimmerman has an African-American neighbor with whom he is

because to win a successful self-defense argument, doesn\u0027t George Zimmerman have to establish in the jury\u0027s eyes that he was attacked first?","answer":"That\u0027s a good way to start because if you\u0027re the attacker then obviously you have a lot more to do in order to be able to claim self-defense.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":196,"aSentId":197},{"question":"Is that all that

right?","answer":"Right.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":252,"aSentId":253},{"question":"I put a hand over that, right?","answer":"OK.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":255,"aSentId":256},{"question":"What do you expect my hand to have on it?","answer":"Blood.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":257,"aSentId":258},{"question":"Why would there be no DNA whatsoever on Trayvon Martin that related to the gun or to George

have.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":273,"aSentId":274},{"question":"But in the end, you are still left, aren\u0027t you, with unanswered questions, and the big question for me and I think many people is, if there are so many unanswered questions, will the jury be able to let him just walk free?","answer":"I don\u0027t -- he\u0027s cutting out.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":290,"aSentId":291},{"question":"Was there any conversation with law enforcement before that as to how to accomplish or finding the tapes for these witnesses before

would be played?","answer":"The decision was made to make them public.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":319,"aSentId":320},{"question":"I mean, it was a curious set of events, wasn\u0027t it, after Trayvon Martin died?","answer":"Absolutely and I think part of it was a political response to, you know, what was beginning to be civic unrest.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":331,"aSentId":332},{"question":"Shawn Holley, I mean, have politics taken over from law enforcement here?","answer":"Well, if so, it really was just a response to what -- how this whole thing started.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":337,"aSentId":338},{"question":"And we assume that he was stunned, if that is all right, was he justified given he\u0027s legally allowed to carry a firearm, and he\u0027s stunned, he\u0027s incoherent, is he justified in self-defense in using that weapons?","answer":"Let me first say that I don\u0027t concede that that hypothetical is not also counter functional.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":355,"aSentId":356},{"question":"What will the ramifications be of this case, do you think?","answer":"Well, I don\u0027t

explanation?","answer":"I don\u0027t know what the hell --","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":410,"aSentId":411},{"question":"What have you learned about perhaps the difficulties of the job that I do and other news anchors do from doing now two seasons of \"Newsroom\"?","answer":"Well, having to do all the homework on -- like for the Zimmerman trial, like you just did, I mean, you really have to become an expert on whatever the issue is of the day.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":432,"aSentId":433},{"question":"Because it has in a strange way, it\u0027s gripped many Americans, others think, you know, that the networks are going to be gone this and in the end it\u0027s just another murder case or many other in America every day, but I think it says more about America, but what do you think?","answer":"I agree.","docId":"130709pmt","qSentId":444,"aSentId":445},{"question":"What about self-defense, guns, the right of an American to carry one in the first place in that situation and to use it, and potentially he may well walk away a freeman?","answer":"Yes, well, I\u0027m one of the guys that goes back to the Second Amendment and just goes, you know what, it was a different time and now we\u0027re into the Sandy Hooks and the -- you know, all of that and whatever happened between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin that night, only they
