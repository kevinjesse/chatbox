I\u0027ve been catching up throughout the day looking at different clips after it was determined they -- the defense was not going to call me to testify.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":110,"aSentId":111},{"question":"And so we can never get beyond Trayvon Martin just walking home and a strange man chasing him, doesn\u0027t Trayvon Martin have the right to self-defense?","answer":"But here\u0027s the problem, Ben Crump, is that many people will have absolute sympathy with what you\u0027re saying, but at the same time you say chase the evidence.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":117,"aSentId":118},{"question":"Regardless of that, you are now left with the jury that believed Trayvon was on top and they are more likely, are they not, to assume that the voice crying out for help is the person underneath?","answer":"Piers, it has always been our contention that there was some struggle and if Trayvon defended himself against a strange

David Webb, I mean, people like Bill O\u0027Reilly have made the point, look, you know, there are -- in Chicago over the long holiday weekend, nearly 70 people were shot, many of them young black youths shooting each other, and it barely resonates on the national stage, yet here we are gripped by the Zimmerman- Trayvon Martin case.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":393,"aSentId":394},{"question":"Why is the balance so skewed toward this case and not to 70 shot in Chicago?","answer":"Or to Trevor Dooley who by the way is a

--","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":498,"aSentId":499},{"question":"Final question, what do you think they\u0027re going to do?","answer":"I have no idea.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":513,"aSentId":514},{"question":"David?","answer":"I think the prosecution has not made the case for second- degree murder.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":518,"aSentId":519},{"question":"How about manslaughter or aggravated assault?","answer":"Possibly down and depends on the instructions but they have not made the case beyond a reasonable doubt.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":520,"aSentId":521},{"question":"What do you make of this trial?","answer":"Well, you know, I look at it first as a lawyer and the legal issues I think have been articulated pretty well on many of your programs.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":536,"aSentId":537},{"question":"I mean, here\u0027s the question I think that, you know, someone just raised to me during the break there, which is that if George Zimmerman hadn\u0027t had the gun on him, would he have felt empowered or courageous enough to have got out of his vehicle and to have started walking in the direction of this tall young black teenager?","answer":"Right.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":542,"aSentId":543},{"question":"I mean, the thing is a total farce, isn\u0027t it?","answer":"Well, it doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense to me.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":554,"aSentId":555},{"question":"How important do you think will be the fact that the jury is entirely female and five of them are mothers?","answer":"UROW: You know, the classic learning on this, I think that the prosecution is hoping that they see Trayvon as their child, and they may.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":561,"aSentId":562},{"question":"If we -- if we got to the last page of a book you\u0027d written about this case, Scott, would you have guilty or not guilty?","answer":"I don\u0027t think Mr. Zimmerman is going to be convicted.","docId":"130710pmt","qSentId":575,"aSentId":576}]
