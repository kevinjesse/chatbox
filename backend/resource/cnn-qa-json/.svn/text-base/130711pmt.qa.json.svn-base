[{"question":"How do you feel the day went?","answer":"I think the day was very strong, and Piers, I think you pointed out right the inconsistencies Bernie used that to show that this jury should not believe anything that he says and that at the end of the day Trayvon Martin did nothing to cause his own death.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":86,"aSentId":87},{"question":"What was the purpose of that because it got rejected?","answer":"Well, as I heard, they were attempting to use that with the possibility that there was a lesser part of that involved child abuse that would have in essence

summation.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":108,"aSentId":109},{"question":"But do you think that manslaughter is a more likely verdict here given all you\u0027ve heard?","answer":"Definitely, and in most states, any reasonable view of the evidence that would support manslaughter would -- it would be given anyhow.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":117,"aSentId":118},{"question":"Do you think generally the defense has done a better job than the prosecution from a legal point of view?","answer":"I think they\u0027ve both done a good job but I think the defense has done a superb job and they\u0027ve had a good no nonsense judge whom I -- kind of like the way I think I was when I was on the bench, you know.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":121,"aSentId":122},{"question":"Would you be annoyed by Don West and the way he\u0027s gone about his business or is that just far from the court?","answer":"It\u0027s so standard.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":123,"aSentId":124},{"question":"Going to be trying it up, right?","answer":"Well, it\u0027s just -- I mean, it was unfair surprise.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":152,"aSentId":153},{"question":"Now you see, that is all indisputably true, isn\u0027t it?","answer":"No question.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":177,"aSentId":178},{"question":"And from your eyes, Judge Leslie, what is the crucial part of the narrative that could determine whether George Zimmerman is

it.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":224,"aSentId":225},{"question":"Invoking Martin Luther King there, a good strategy or not to bring race front and center into this trial when people have been perhaps tactfully trying to avoid that?","answer":"Well, you know, Piers, everybody has tried to tiptoe around about this.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":229,"aSentId":230},{"question":"I mean, do you think there should have been any other options that can be presented to them or is that a satisfactory choice?","answer":"I think that is the choice and what you have to understand, and once again there have been some analysts that don\u0027t understand Florida law and even some from Florida don\u0027t know it that we have lesser included offenses under Florida law in different categories.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":262,"aSentId":263},{"question":"It was always going to be on the table?","answer":"It\u0027s not even nonsense.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":274,"aSentId":275},{"question":"What do you think the rationale is behind what many view as a very surprising decision by him to say I had nothing to do with

shot in Chicago?","answer":"Or to Trevor Dooley (ph) who by the way is a black man who was (inaudible) stand your ground law to defend himself when he shot a white man.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":418,"aSentId":419},{"question":"What matters is did George Zimmerman think I\u0027m going to die?","answer":"Right.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":469,"aSentId":470},{"question":"I mean, we don\u0027t actually know, do we?","answer":"Right.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":471,"aSentId":472},{"question":"Do you?","answer":"Well, to hear the inconsistencies with that story, right, in order for you to believe what

Trayvon.","docId":"130711pmt","qSentId":476,"aSentId":477},{"question":"...something material and important that George Zimmerman has said?","answer":"Well, this is -- well, here,
